## Notes

During the project we learned;

- how to use audio tags,
- how to use data attribute,
- how to use branches under branches and organize project in smaller tasks.

We struggled;

- pushing branches of branches and creating PR correctly,
- splitting the project into small tasks with clear boundaries.
